# Books Sinatra Application with Active Record ORM

- We create a quick scaffolding for the project with the `corneal` gem by running: `corneal new little_books_app`.
- Then start working on the database: complete the migration files and run the migrations.
- Start working on the models and use macros to build associations.
- Add the appropriate controllers and view files
- run `shotgun` to start the server (always quit with cntrl + c)
